        "Update logic for finding project properties to use MSBuild instead of parsing the project file directly. See https://learn.microsoft.com/en-us/visualstudio/msbuild/customize-your-build?view=vs-2022 for more details.",
        "Fix 'SelfContained' property reading logic to actually read the value from the properties. Previously we were only checking that the value could be parsed and not reading the actual value."
